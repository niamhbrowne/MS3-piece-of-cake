### Design Choices
I chose a simplistic webpage design as I don't want to over complicate it.  I want users to easily find their way through the webpage and therefore have chosen to use a simple navbar with dropdown links to help users choose what they want to see quickly and easily. I want to add loads of images to keep users interested in the page. I have added interactive buttons and links on the home page to keep users interested and to keep it simple for them finding information.
